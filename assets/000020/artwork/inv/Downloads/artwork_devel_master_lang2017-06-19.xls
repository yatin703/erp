1) We kept the Photocell mark in Front Panel as you mentioned.(Usually we kept the Photocell mark in Back Panel, so please confirm us.)
2) We kept the following sentence in Back panel i.e. `` PHYSICIAN`S SAMPLE NOT TO BE SOLD ``
3) Increased the size of following things for avoiding the smudgyness  while the printing.
    i.e. Pierre Fabre(in back panel), PIERRE FABRE ORAL CARE along with circular design(in front panel below the photocell mark).
4) Reverse text on Red color(P 200C) Patch it will be chance to get smudge while the printing.
5) The text Pierre Fabre(in back panel) in gray color, so please confirm which color we should take for printing.

It won`t look like already printed tubes because the Background light blue patch is  just light blue colour and different  from previous printed one as it was Pantone 291 C. It also won`t have sharp look as per last printed tubes because of the same reason. 

2) In received artwork curve line below word ``Hydroheal`` is in Green colour but it goes 7th colour and we have already 6 colour printed in last  printed tube and offset printing machine`s 6 colour contstrains, so we converted it into Dark Blue colour i.e. Pantone Reflex Blue C ( as per last printed ) 

3) The text line ``Amorphus Hydrogel Wound Dressing with Colloidal silver`` was in 90% Black which may look crooked because of black dots. so we converted it into 100 % solid Black colour. 

4) Light Gray circle behind ``SilverSol Technology`` is in 10 % Black so we converted it into Pantone Cool Gray 2 C. BUT in previous artwork it was in colour Silver Pantone 877 C. 

5) In 50 g tube (i.e. in artwork AW0099 ) halftone circles are looking as they are shrunk from up and down side 

6)  In 50 g tube (i.e. in artwork AW0099 ), there is White halftone behind Hydroheal AM, it will look like patchy patchy so we can add there at least 1% dots of same light Blue colour. The same white colour halftone is NOT there in previous printed tube artwork. 

7) We increased Registration logo i.e. ``R and circle around it`` as it was too small and non-readable. 

8) Also note that the customer Name in Artwork approval format is different in both artwork.

We increase the size of “®” and “TM” but still that might get smudged while print because it’s too much small and in reverse format.

We made some corrections in the artwork as per shown in attached scanned copy to the below email from your end.

1) We increased space for Sealing and Non-Lacquering Area to 23 mm ( instead of 7 mm )

2) The space for No Print Area at Open End is 3 mm which is minimum requirement for technical purpose.So we cannot reduce more space at Open End.

3) The space for No Print Area at Shoulder End is 5 mm which is our Standard space as per our requirement for technical purpose. So we cannot reduce it any more..

4) We separated White Colour in two i.e. 
       1) White_Plt 1 - for Overlapping Patch behind Black Patch ( as per shown in the received artwork from your end ) Also needed it behind halftone image of ``C`` and `CAMPUS`

       2) White_Plt 2 - for better visibility, we made Text Matter as overprinting on Black Patch as they are very small and can be smudged while Exposing it on the Silk Screen Cloth if we take it as reverse on Black Patch.

5) We also corrected Tube Sleeve size  and print type below artwork layout.

ii) Also increased the sentence ``Warning . . . .  offence.`` as it was too small and would have not even exposed on screen.
iii) We also had to increase VLCC logo and rectangle around it as there are 4 colours to print one on other to avoid miss-registration problem
iv) We also increased logos of Recyclebin, Green dot, as there are 2 colours to print one on other to avoid miss-registration problem and so accordingly we had to increase logo of animal to keep uniformity with other logos of Recyclebin and Green dot.
v) We also reduced Bars of Barcode and adjusted it in White colour Background Patch keeping 1 mm tolerance space on each side of it to avoid miss-registration.
vi) To adjust all those logos and Barcode etc. on Back Panel we had to adjust text matters around them.

Received both 15g and 50g artwork through CD are having many differences from existing artwork (which is already printed) as per below mentioned. 

1) Background patch and Halftone Circles are in one single image which is in CMYK colour and very low resolution so it may look smudgy (blurr) look, so arrange the image with high resolutions. It won`t look like already printed tubes because the Background light blue patch is  just light blue colour and different  from previous printed one as it was Pantone 291 C. It also won`t have sharp look as per last printed tubes because of the same reason. 

2) In received artwork curve line below word ``Hydroheal`` is in Green colour but it goes 7th colour and we have already 6 colour printed in last  printed tube and offset printing machine`s 6 colour contstrains, so we converted it into Dark Blue colour i.e. Pantone Reflex Blue C ( as per last printed ) 

3) The text line ``Amorphus Hydrogel Wound Dressing with Colloidal silver`` was in 90% Black which may look crooked because of black dots. so we converted it into 100 % solid Black colour. 

4) Light Gray circle behind ``SilverSol Technology`` is in 10 % Black so we converted it into Pantone Cool Gray 2 C. BUT in previous artwork it was in colour Silver Pantone 877 C. 

5) In 50 g tube (i.e. in artwork AW0099 ) halftone circles are looking as they are shrunk from up and down side 

6)  In 50 g tube (i.e. in artwork AW0099 ), there is White halftone behind Hydroheal AM, it will look like patchy patchy so we can add there at least 1% dots of same light Blue colour. The same white colour halftone is NOT there in previous printed tube artwork. 

7) We increased Registration logo i.e. ``R and circle around it`` as it was too small and non-readable. 

8) Also note that the customer Name in Artwork approval format is different in both artwork.

As per received file we developed the artwork.
Please note that we kept the eyemark size and position as per previous version.
We increase the size of “®” and “TM” but still that might get smudged while print because it’s too much small and in reverse format.

1) We increased the font size of registered `` R `` by 5 to 8% for avoiding the smugness while the printing.

As per your mail we developed the artwork with following details.

1) Due to machine constrained we should have to kept the 2mm space between Open end to Photocell mark, as in your artwork Photocell mark start from open end.

2) We are using the P 355 C instead of CYAN(for Leaf) as per your all Lip Balm existing artworks. So kindly confirm for the same.

We have to make some following changes in the artwork.
1) Text matter on Back Panel was rotated in 180 degree ( Ingrediants paragraphs at Shoulder End and last sentence ``TM: Trademark applied for`` towards Open End)

2) The artwork we received from your end was not fitting in 92 mm length ( tube sleeve length 108 mm leaving 11mm + 5mm space for No Print Area for technical purpose ) so accordingly we had to reduce it by 8 mm ( we reduced two green colour bands and front panel matter but didn`t reduced size of Back panel text matter )

3)  The Front Panel and Back Panel in the artwork we received were in `V` shape containing a vignette of Pantone Warm Gray 1 on Back ground so we made that vignette full overlapping for tube circumference.

4) The artwork we received from your end was in 7 colours ( as below mentioned ) so we removed one colour i.e. Dark Green colour overlapping  two Bands one at Shoulder End and other at Open End and converted it in Pantone 3005 C ( which is for logotype of ``CURATIO`` )
    I) Warm Gray 1 C ( Background Vignette)
    ii) P 4745 C ( two curves and word ``wash``)
    iii) Black  ( Text Matter )
    iv) Red P 485 C ( Stripe behind the text ``Physician`s Sample not to be sold`` on Front Panel and  ``Physician`s Sample not to be sold`` on Back Panel
    v) P 1815 C Dark Red ( text `mela` and some texts on Back Panel )

2) As concerning Screen Printing process the whole text matter on Back Panel is very small and thin and condensed ( font size is around 4.8 pt)  so it may be smudgy. We increased paragraph of contact detail with Rectangle width by 3 mm but still we have doubt it may look smudgy while printing as it is very small and condensed.

3) Barcode digit ` 0 ` is shown in the artwork we received from your end, is it fake barcode ?

We increased the font size of register mark `R`.
We will follow leaf colour scheme as per your below instructions , but please note that it will look in different shade as percentage of colour given by your end and the percentage we use actually while process is different. Please confirm for the same.
Vegetarian Logo, Cap logo are too much small it will get smudge while printing.

We made some changes in the artwork as per concerning Screen Printing process.

1) In original artwork we received from your end, there was Transperancy Effect on `` + `` (plus) marks on the back ground artwork so we matched their colour to Pantone Colour shade to Pantone 212 C and made them in solid colour. Please note kindly suggest us if you have any suggestions for Pantone Matching Shades

2) Bar Code was too small and not sensed by Barcode Senser at our end so we had to increase it as far as possible, we also increased ``Vegetable Mineral Kingdom - tree logo``, ``Not Tested on Animal logo`` and ``100% Veg logo`` as far as possible as the text below them were too small and non-readable and also could not be exposed on the screen for print process. So accordingly to adjust those increased things on Back Panel, we had to re-align all paragraphs.

3) We also increased ``TM`` and ``R and circle around it`` as they were smaller to expose.

1) In original artwork we received from your end, there was Transperancy Effect on `` + `` (plus) marks on the back ground artwork so we matched their colour to Pantone Colour shade to Pantone 298 C and made them in solid colour. Kindly suggest us if you have any suggestions for Pantone Matching Shades

2) Bar Code was too small and not sensed by Barcode Senser at our end so we had to increase it as far as possible, we also increased ``Vegetable Mineral Kingdom - tree logo``, ``Not Tested on Animal logo`` and ``100% Veg logo`` as far as possible as the text below them were too small and non-readable and also could not be exposed on the screen for print process. So accordingly to adjust those increased things on Back Panel, we had to re-align all paragraphs.

3) We removed ``w`` from `Newtwork` and made it ``Network``

We mark below point for the printing point of view.

Back Panel Text matters are too small and condensed(they are joined to each other, not enough space between two characters and words)
After the printing they will get smudged and non readable. Kindly use the empty space towards sealing area(as shown by Red color rectangular box).

NOTE :- We required font size is above 3.5pt.(Maintain the font size of TM also).</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW1060</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per your revised CDR we developed the artwork with below mentioned changes.

1) We Replaced the font style Regular  instead of Condanced for avoiding the smudgyness only in Back Panel.
2) Realigned the whole artwork including Front and Back Panel.
3) As well as whole Front Panel shifted upward for aesthetic look.

NOTE :- In your revised CDR mentioned only ONE color for the printing, i.e. P Cool Gray 11 C, please confirm.

We developed the artwork as per the CDR file we received from your end.
1) We kept 85% strength Pantone Process Magenta C for  `` + `` (plus) marks on the back ground artwork as per other variants

2) Bar Code was too small and not sensed by Barcode Senser at our end so we had to increase it as far as possible, we also increased ``Vegetable Mineral Kingdom - tree logo``, ``Not Tested on Animal logo`` and ``100% Veg logo`` as far as possible as the text below them were too small and non-readable and also could not be exposed on the screen for print process.

We have developed the artwork as per your mail with below mentioned 
changes due to Screen printing process constrained.

1) On Back Panel, we had to increase text line `` Manufactured By ``  and 
address sentence ``Block No 115 . . . . . . .  Gujrat`` as they were too 
small even to expose of Screen frames, and so accordingly we had to make 
address sentence ``Block No 115 . . . . . . .  Gujrat`` in to two lines 
and adjusted it on the Back Panel for which accordingly we had to 
re-align spaces among all paragraphs

2) *As per our Screen Printing Machine constrained please note that 
Black colour printing matter will be shifted by 0.5 mm at Right side or 
Left side OR upwards at Open End or downwards at Shoulder End.*
We mark in PDF where shifting will get while the printing.

While developing we made few changes in the artwork,

As the received design was not fit in standard layout so, we reduced the overall artwork by 5 %.

We convert the CMYK colour scheme into Pantone colour scheme. please confirm for the same.

While developing the artwork the barcode in received design was too small so we increased the barcode and realign vertically.

Also we realign the Mfg par address. and We increased the `®` which was too small

We developed the artwork as per the Corel Draw file we received from your end, concerning Flexo + Screen Printing process.
We made some following changes in the artwork.

1) As per our Flexo machine constrains, we converted the design on the front Panel Panel into CYAN and YELLOW Process colours as it is in Pantone colours i.e. P 3935 C and P 7466 C in the received artowork from your end.

2) The logo of the VESTIGE :- We converted 2 ``V`` above the text ``VESTIGE`` into pantone colors i.e. one in Pantone 355 C and another in Pantone 301 C as per given by your end in colour pallet in the artwork received from your end.

3) We increased Barcode proportionately as it was too small and was not sensing on Bar code scanner at our end, so accordingly we removed the out line rectangle around it.

Some Queries on the Natural Active artwork :- Can we incorporate above mentioned corrections ( i.e. point 2 and point 3 ) on the artwork of AW001163 VESTIGE CC ASSURE NATURAL ACTIVE 60g VER 4 in which
 1) the 2 ``V`` above the text ``VESTIGE`` are Cyan Magenta and Yellow so can we convert them in to Panton colour i.e. Pantone 355 C and Pantone 301 C to keep consistency with NATURAL PURE artwork
2) Barcode is too small and it is NOT sensing on Barcode Scanner at our end so can we increase it as per we increased in NATURAL PURE artwork.

We made corrections as per your instruction on phone on today morning and attached scanned copy to below email.
1) Shifted front panel towards extreme left side ( at the edge of Tube artwork layout ) i.e. Green Patch along with `Chlorhexidine Gel with Fluoride` and `ELGYDIUM` and tooth logo, so accordingly Eymark also shifted (made it at position in front of Tooth logo ) as per your instructions.
2) Also shifted two pargraphs ``Composition . . . . . with a soft toothbrush.`` and ``FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY . . . . . . . date of manufacturing.`` towards left side to make some space to maintain 15 mm space at Open End above the text lines ``Maximum Retail . . . . .B. No. and Mfg. date`` and arrow.
Please note that, it`s impossible to increase the font size of those paragraphsÂ  because it will go out of the artwork layout. (As per your instructions to increase font size of those shifted paragraphs to fill vacant place)
3) We rotated the text lines ``Maximum Retail . . . . .B. No. and Mfg. date`` and arrow along with it at 90 degree and positioned it parallel to Green colour patch on Back Panel. </td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW1230</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per received design we developed the artwork</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW1230</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per reviseddesign we developed the artwork</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW1230</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>3</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per revised design we made changes in the artwork,

Please find attached herewith PDF file for your kind approval for AW001437 BCL LAB KETCONIR SHAMPOO 50 ml VER 1
We developed the artwork as per the Corel Draw file we recevied from your end. We made some changes in the artwork as per concerning offset printing and machine constrains
1) We increased all colour patched on Front Panel towards Left side and on Back Panel towards Right side to make it overlapping on eachother ( as it may view tube base white colour at edge of the artwork )
2) The received artwork was in CMYK process colour and more than 6 colour so as per our Offset machine constrains we had to match the colour as per Pantone Matching Shade and in 6 colours as far as possible. Kindly suggest us Pantone Matching Shades ( colour shades with their numbers )  if you have at your end.

Extremely sorry to have bothered you. 
Please find attached herewith PDF file again for your kind approval.
As we came to understand that there is Silver Hot Foil in the artwork so we changed in colour because in previous version of the artwork the Back Ground Patch we had taken in 60% of Pantone 278 C which was 100% solid on Right Side corner of the Front Panel due to 6 colour limitations. But now due to silver is in hot foil we added one more colour i.e. Pantone 292 C for Right Side corner of the Front Panel and Pantone 277 C for Back Ground Patch so that text matter should not to be smudged.

But now due to silver is in hot foil we added one more colour i.e. Pantone 292 C for Right Side corner of the Front Panel and Pantone 277 C for Back Ground Patch so that text matter should not to be smudged.
Awaiting the earliest reply from your end.

In 3 rd version only added hot foil stamping which was not mentioned in earlier version

1) we increased the logos of ``not tested animal``,``recyclbin``,``cap`` By 12% proportionally because in printing there is smudge.

I was missed this point in my last mail i.e. Kindly notice that, for all
revised FW 120g and 80g artwork we removed the white box which was just behind
the veg logo because it`s not possible over there due to registration and
printing sequence, there will be P 607 C as veg logo background instead of
white, and it can be clearly observed on P 607 C background.

2)	Due to sleeve length i.e. 90mm and received artwork was also in 90mm length as per our offset machine constrains we required minimum 3mm space from open end hence we bring the eye-mark to downwards by 3 mm along with its patch and due to it’s we shifted the VLCC logo downwards by 1.5mm.
3)	We adjust the back panel matter “Regarding Point number 1”
4)	We increase the recycle logo and all graphic symbol on back panel because it was too small.
5)	We increase the height of Hot foil which is just below the VLCC logo to .9mm as it was earlier .6mm

On front panel we there was a gradient (vignette) strip we converted it to 100% (because white behind the vignette will not look properly)

We increased the text “Kokum Butter Moisturizer” and all silver matter to get good printing quality.

While developing we made changes in the artwork,

We removed background gradient part as per our earlier discussion

Also we kept the colour scheme as per attached jpeg.

In attached jpeg there is nowhere Black pantone colour mentioned. but for Barcode and for eyemark we need to give black colour..

We convert green pantone to Yellow colour. (Due to colour scheme exceed than 6 colours.)

Also we give pantone P 221 C for the rectangle behind word `Jeans` also same pantone we used in shoulder end patch (Which was itself in brown colour ).

Also we generate barcode from our end.

Artwork Approval
The artwork file is not a colour proof. The Artwork file is meant to approve the nature and position of texts and patterns to be printed as well as colour of PMS.
Please note if the gradient is present in your artwork, the gradients will not render at printing as they appear on the Artwork file : they are converted into dots of variable intensity which may lead to make the halftone limit visible, depending on the substrate colour and the print colour.
We required Signed/stamped scanned copy while giving approval of artwork(s).

Please note that this is offset printing process and the sleeve colour is dark orange and as we know that the opacity/density of offset colour are lower than the screen colours so as a result the readability of the text and colours output will not look enhance as compare to screen printed tube.
Also the font size of the back panel text and reverse text are too much small which may cause the smudging while printing.

Apart from that please note that in received artwork we have to take 1 extra colour station for silver colour  for printing but we have already consume 6 station which is our maximum limit in offset .Therefore, we have convert silver colour into black percentage.so as a result the patch will look crucked after printing.

As per below mail we reduce the thickness of the box which is around the text “FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY” on the back panel.
Also note that we already said in earlier mail that there is no extra printing station for silver colour hence it’s converted in percentage of black colour which cause crucked result at the time of printing. If you want to take it in separate silver pantone then we have to reduce on colour from artwork. (pls. confirm this point.)

As per received file we developed the artwork,

While developing we made below changes

1) Received artwork length was 58 mm where as in ADP it`s mentioned as 55mm. So We developed as per 55mm.

2) We realigned the back panel to set the artwork in 55mm length instead of 58mm.

3) Please note Around 1mm part from front panel is parallel to bottom of the registration mark,But as confirmed by mathew it will not create any problem during printing as well as capping.

Please note below points and check the artwork thoroughly before giving approval.
§  We increase the size of “®” and “TM” to make it printable as it was too much small.
§  Small shadow removed from underneath of lemon for sharp printing.
§  White patch and dots are extended upto net to make it print from shoulder.
§  Grey dot we will print as HB (High brilliant) silver dots which will make more shine as compared to current label sample.
§  Green band will be in metallic finish.
§  Overall tube will be in full gloss finish.
§  We will finish this trial in two options
§  Option – A (Artwork + hotfoil)
§  As we have foil shifting constraint so there will be shifting of foil around 1mm.
§  We make foil (which is around the word “Parachute”) enlarge to make it apart from band name “Parachute” around by 1mm to avoid overlapping of foil on brand name
§  Option –B (Artwork + Silver Printing) replacement of foil with HB silver.
§  For Opt-B we are not providing any artwork as of now we will submit this option at the time of proofing only.
§  Brightness of white colour will not exactly match with label as our substrate/base is dark blue coloured hence white will be look little dull, actual output will be easily understand at the time of proofing.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW3749</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per received mail we change only artwork Number (AW003020)  to  (AW003749) and also changed print type Offset to Screen.

Artwork Approval
The artwork file is not a colour proof. The Artwork file is meant to approve the nature and position of texts and patterns to be printed as well as colour of PMS.
Please note the gradients will not render at printing as they appear on the Artwork file : they are converted into dots of variable intensity which may lead to make the halftone limit visible, depending on the substrate colour and the print colour.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>1</td></tr><tr><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>000020</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>AW3836</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>2</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>As per received file we developed the artwork.
